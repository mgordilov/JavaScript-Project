- 🔭 I’m currently working on [my JavaScript project](https://mgordilov.github.io/JavaScript-Project/):

- This project is like a safe island, where each user can be sure that his data will not be leaked.
- One of the function inside the project is a password generator, which can help users create a strong password based on their
- needs (specifically the number of letters, numbers and symbols is chosen be the user). A good bonus is the fact that this tool
- awares the user in case if the total length of the pass is less than 8 or more than 18 (well, I tried to maintain worldwide
- standards). In order to generate a password, the user will need to fill all the input boxes and to click on the "Generate"
- button. On the line below a generated password will appear. In case the user doesn't like the generated password, he could
- either to generate the new one (by clicking once again on the "Generate" button), or to change the combination numbers and to
- create a completely new password.
  
- Another function is called De(en)code, which takes the text the user inputs and encrypts or decrypts it. Generally speaking
- it's a caesar cypher which changes the text on the input. Once the user starts typing the text is automatically "translated"
- in the other window. There are two options: to encrypt the text or to decrypt it. For encryption, the user needs to enter the
- input in the left window and for decryption in the right one. There are no buttons, since the text is "translated" automatic
- and "on-the-go".

- There is also "Join us" section which contains a form that the user can complete and it will be automatically sent to the
- developer (me). Unfortunately, it doesn't send a mail using the self-developed server, but it is integrated using a third-
- party tool.
